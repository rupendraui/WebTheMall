these all three pages consists the different paatern of design like in brand story i have used panel and under that panel foloowing the bootstrap column method.

and in new mall i have used panel but insise that panel i hav eused carousel.

and in new s again i have followed the same pattern as in brand story but this includes only pics 

now coming to the shop's which tells you about the different level of the mall and which shop is there in which level.

when you click the level it will give you the list of the shops which is present in that level.

last is contact which will  you to get feedback from the user about the  THE MALL.
